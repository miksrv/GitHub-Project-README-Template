<!-- ABOUT OF PROJECT -->
## About of Project

Many existing **README** templates offer good solutions, but they often miss important points that are necessary for creating truly functional and understandable documentation. That’s why I created this template — universal and thought out to the smallest detail to save you time and make it easier to get started.

Why choose this template?

1. **Focus on simplicity and efficiency.** Instead of spending time on developing the README structure every time, you can focus on developing the project. This template offers a basic structure that covers all the main aspects and can be easily adapted to any needs.
2. **Support for modularity.** The template is built in such a way that you can add and remove sections as needed without violating the overall logic and structure. This is convenient for both large projects and small utilities.
3. **Optimized for SEO and project representation.** README does not just describe the project — it serves as its business card. The template is structured in a way that will help your project stand out and attract more attention on GitHub.
4. **Automation and minimization of repetitive tasks.** Developers spend a lot of time on monotonous processes. The template allows you to avoid routine when creating a project description by providing universal blocks that can be easily modified to suit specific needs.
5. **Flexibility and scalability.** Each project is unique, and this template is created with this in mind. You can easily adapt it to any type of project - from libraries and frameworks to applications and services.
6. **Attention to detail.** Important details that are often missed in other templates are included - such as instructions for getting started, code samples, licensing, information for contributors. All this makes the template a complete tool for development.
7. **Community and feedback.** The template is created not for one project, but for many, and will only improve over time thanks to suggestions from the community. You can always make your suggestions and improvements.

If you need a quick and effective solution for starting a new project, this template is exactly what you need. Start with the BLANK_README.md file and feel the difference.
